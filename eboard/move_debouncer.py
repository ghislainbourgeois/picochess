class MoveDebouncer(object):
    """
    MoveDebouncer debounces FENs received from an e-board if a move is detected and the move is extendable.
    A move is extendable if the piece of the current move could move further to another square.
    For example, the move pawn to e3 in the starting position is extendable because the pawn could move to e4 instead.
    The pawn move to e4 cannot be extended since the pawn could not move on in one move.
    Since this class has no game information, king moves are potentially always extendable, even if the king has already
    castled.

    TODO: Consider direction. The current implementation does not check the direction of the moving piece,
          that is, even if there are no more squares available in the direction in which a piece is being moved,
          if there are other moves available for this piece in other directions, the move is currently determined to be
          extendable.
